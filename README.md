# Cross-Lingual Client-Server Application

## Project Overview

This project implements a client-server application capable of handling requests from both Hindi and Telugu clients.  The server processes these requests using a trained model (details of which are found within the Jupyter Notebook).  The `Dataset Link.txt` file presumably contains a link to the dataset used for model training.


## Features

* **Multilingual Support:** Handles client requests in Hindi and Telugu.
* **Client-Server Architecture:** Uses a client-server model for communication.
* **Model-Driven Processing:** Employs a trained machine learning model for request processing.


## Installation

This project uses Python.  It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing project dependencies.  Create and activate a virtual environment using your preferred method (e.g., `venv`, `conda`, `virtualenv`).

Once activated, install the necessary packages.  While a `requirements.txt` file is not provided,  you will likely need to install common Python packages for data science and networking.  You may need to manually install packages based on the import statements within `Hindi Client.py` and `Telugu Client.py` and any libraries used within `Server and Model Training.ipynb`.  A typical installation might involve:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas requests scikit-learn  # Add other necessary packages as needed
```

Refer to the `Server and Model Training.ipynb` notebook for specific package requirements of the model.


## Usage

1. **Server Setup:** Run the server component.  The exact method for running the server is not explicitly defined in the provided file structure.  This requires examining `Server and Model Training.ipynb` to determine the appropriate commands to launch the server (e.g., using a web framework such as Flask or FastAPI).

2. **Client Interaction:** Execute either `Hindi Client.py` or `Telugu Client.py` to interact with the server, sending requests and receiving responses.  The specifics of how to use these clients will depend on their implementation.  Again, examining the code will be necessary.

3. **Model Training (if needed):** The `Server and Model Training.ipynb` notebook contains the code for training the machine learning model. Run this notebook to train and save the model if required before running the server.


**Note:**  This README is generated based solely on the provided directory structure and file names.  More detailed instructions may require examining the code within each file.  The Dataset Link may need to be downloaded and processed before model training.
